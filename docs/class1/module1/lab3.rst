#. What should you do here now that we are doing HTTPS?
#. Click the Finished button
#. Open the Firefox browser
#. Click the 3 horizontal line button on the far right of the address bar
#. Click on HTTPFox and toggle on
#. Click the Start button on the HTTPFox window
#. Enter http://dvwa.f5lab.com/  and ensure you get there and it is HTTPS
#. Now enter http://wackopicko.f5lab.com/ and ensure you get there via HTTPS
#. Finally, enter http://peruggia.f5lab.com/ and ensure you can get to that app via HTTPS
#. Look at the headers for each of your requests. Did you log them all? What is the value of the Server header? None of this should have changed since the last lab.
